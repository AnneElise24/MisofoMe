# MisofoMe
It's a redesign of the MisofoMe app

The MisofoMe app is a digital platform where people with misophony can help eachother with their disorder by sharing excercises expecially made fot it. In this prototype I made a redesign for the part in the app where users can add a excersise of their own to the platform. In earlier prototypes there was not spend much time and effort on this part, while it's so important to think about how to design this part. 

The prototype is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the first place I worked with CSS snap points for the different questions of the form, but eventually let that out and changed the structure into a page per question, because it wasn't working how I wanted it to work. I mentioned on the Issues page, where you can also see more parts of the app that are not working completely yet. Feel free to make changes to improve the application.
