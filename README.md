# MisofoMe
It's a redesign of the MisofoMe app

The MisofoMe app is a digital platform where people with misophony can help eachother with their disorder by sharing excercises expecially made fot it. In this prototype I made a redesign for the part in the app where users can add a excersise of their own to the platform. In earlier prototypes there was not spend much time and effort on this part, while it's so important to think about how to design this part.
